* Made year value in copyright more easily configured.
* Historic 1/2up button styled as requested.
* Custom message for CRS error when uploading annotation(s) fixed.
* Overview map only requests maps when panel expanded.
* Open -> Annotations from file... window title updated and debug statements causing problems in IE have been removed.
* Removed 2nd sentence from boilerplate text from Save Map window.
* Marine GetFeatureInfo no longer shows values of zero, this hides invalid attributes for 'Depth Area' e.g. 'Spot Height'.
  NOTE: This needs checking in other clients as zero may be valid for other attributes, if so raise an issue and we will
        have another look.
* Made 'Stroke Style' group button wider to accomodate icon.
* Refactored validation regex for lat/lon D/M/S search, this allows lat/lon from latitude: 45 to 67 degrees, longitude: -15 to 15 degrees.
  NOTE: There is a bug whereby 45N, -15E is validated, this is due to making the - symbol optional for 'W' as requested, we've not found a 
        way to make this work with -15E validating false.
* All 'Advanced Search' fields listen for the return/enter button, search is invoked.
* Legend text wrapping should not wrap so quickly.
* General bug fixes.
